# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git stands for global information tracker. It is a tool used by programmers to effectively and efficiently work on code. The structure consists of a main branch that contains all the merged code and side branches that programmers can work on without affecting the main branch. Multiple groups of programmers can work on different branches for different areas of code so that not one group is left waiting for another to complete their code. While git is the tool that allows programmers to code together, Github is the platform/workspace. Code can be used by git to send to Github so that other programmers can see the work that another has done. On Github, we can review the codes pushed onto branches, create pull requests, and merge the side branches to the main branch.

Researched answer: Git is a version control system that allows us to keep track of our code history. In Github, we can make and manage repositories. While we need git to use Github, we do not need Github to use git. There are platforms other than Github that we can use git with. Github is simply the first, which is why when we send code to Github using terminals, it is referred to as origin.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: A Boolean value is true or false, and the operators == (loosely equal), === (strictly equal), > (greater than), >= (greater than or qual to), < (less than), <= (less than or qual to), !== (strictly not equal) will return a Boolean value.

Researched answer: There is also the != (loosely not equal) operator. We can combine conditions using these operators with && (AND) and || (OR). With &&, both conditions must be true for it to be true. With ||, one condition must be true for it to be true.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index indicates the location of a value within an element. We indicate an index using brackets. Unlike counting with length, counting with indexes starts at 0. The index refers to the location while the value is the actual data that the index is referring to.

Researched answer: The index tells us the position of a certain element. When we use index for strings, each number position will refer to a character within the string. For arrays, indexes will refer to the different values in it.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is running through a code. In the case of for loops and while loops, programs will iterate through these loops until there is an indiction to stop.

Researched answer: Iteration refers to the repeated execution of a code, and a code will be iterated through until the specified end result is reached. When a code block is repeated multiple times, that is called a loop. When the code is run through one time, that is a single iteration.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming consists of a driver and a navigator. The driver is the person typing out the code, and the navigator is the person telling the driver what to type out. The navigator should properly explain their thought processes and let the driver know why they are having the driver type out that code. Meanwhile, the driver should follow what the navigator says, but they should speak up if they have their own opinion about the code or maybe have their own approach.

Researched answer: By having two people working on code, it is more likely to result in fewer defects. With the separate roles of the programmers, one person may have more experience or knowledge about a certain aspect of code and can navigate that part of the code, or if the navigator is too focused on one way of thinking, the driver may be able to help with a different perspective.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: a higher order function takes a function as an argument and returns another function as a result. As a program iterates through an array with a for loop, it will return one value with each iteration. However, with a higher order function such as .map(), if we use this on an array, another array will be returned.

2. Jest: Jest is a framework that allows us to test our Javascript code to ensure that it is working properly and producing the results we want. By testing the code and thinking of our inputs and outputs, it helps us as developers to understand the problem better and write better code.

3. Objects: Object is a JavaScript data type used to store collections of data with the key:value structure. Similar to how we find values in an array with an index, we can find the value within an object using keys.

4. Method: A method is a function that exists within an object. When writing function code in an object, instead of using the variable name, the keyword "this" can be used to refer to the object instead.

5. Classes: A class is a sort of function that includes objects.
